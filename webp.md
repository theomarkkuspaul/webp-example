The digital mediums through which we consume information has sparked significant performance breakthroughs. As the platforms that allow us to take, process, and share high-quality images grow evermore available, it comes as no surprise that the technologies to distribute this content has continued to evolve as well.

One of the ways image optimisation has comes leaps and bounds is through 'WebP', which is soon to hit a double-digit lifespan.

WebP is a image file format developed by Google that "provides superior lossless and lossy compression for images on the web". Sounds pretty good right?

But why should we care? And how do they fit alongside jpgs and pngs?

To answer this, let's go over some Pro's and Con's.

Pros:
* Reduced filesize due to advancements in Lossy and Lossless compression
  * Less bandwidth required to fulfill request, improving user experience
* WebPs (weppys) are on the forefront of the latest developments in image compression. Large backing, promotion, and support by Google.

Cons:
* Not supported by Internet Explorer and Safari
* Additional markup required to get Safari working


To see the immediate benefit of WebP, we are going to look at an example webpage comparing the same image with the `.jpg` and `.webp` extensions.




### Gifs and WebP

The <picture> element and webps don't just end there, they also can animated image files, such as GIFs!

`gif2webp` binary can be used to convert `.gif`s into `.webp`s

Given a <picture> element, you can simply declare a <source> similarly to webps and jpgs. The browser will figure out the rest!

Download, unzip, and run the binary to convert your gif files. The download link is as follows: https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/download

Results may vary when it comes to file size reduction for GIF conversion.
